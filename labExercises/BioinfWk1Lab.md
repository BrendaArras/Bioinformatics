#Bioinformatics Week 1 Lab: Jan 15, 2015
##Introduction to GitHub and Markdown

Slides for the introduction to today's lab, as well as a PDF of this document, can be found on [Blackboard](http://blackboard.uttyler.edu).

###Learning Objectives
1. Conceptualize version control and collaborative research using the GitHub web interface
2. Submit your homework electronically through a GitHub repository
3. Format text using a simple computer language (markdown)
4. Apply information from basic software documentation to perform bioinformatics tasks

###Activities
* Create a GitHub account 
	* Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com) in a web browser (Firefox preferred) and sign up for GitHub using your university email address. You may eventually use this account as a professional resource, so I recommend using an appropriate username. ["How to pick the right username"](http://www.reputation.com/reputationwatch/articles/how-pick-right-username) provides a few guidelines if you are unsure about what is appropriate. Please note that your full name will be displayed as a part of this repository. If you are concerned about privacy, you are not required to use your legal name (but please note this when filling out the "GitHub survey" Blackboard, described below in "Assessment.").
	* Apply for a GitHub Student Developer Pack. This collection of developer tools is available to students for free, and includes an upgraded GitHub account that allows private repositories. Later in today's lab, you will make a private repo for yourself and share it with your instructor so you can submit homework confidentially.
		* Go to [the application page](https://education.github.com/pack/join) and confirm you are a student. 
		* You will be prompted to enter an image of your student ID. We can scan an image in class if you did not bring one.
		* For "How do you plan to use GitHub?" please write a few sentences indicating you are a student in bioinformatics and will be using GitHub to develop a collection of example code and submit homework.
		* It may take a day or so for the request for student developer tools to be approved, so watch your email for the confirmation notice.

* Go through GitHub's introductory material
	* Navigate in a web browser to [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com)
	* Work through the instructions on the following guides. Your assessment for today's lab will include confirmation of completion of the tasks listed below. Keep in mind that links are highlighted in blue and may contain additional information if you have questions:
		* **Hello World:** :pencil2: When you are finished with this guide, you will have created a repo called hello-world, opened an issue, created a branch, made a commit, opened a pull request, and merged a pull request.
		* **Forking Projects:** When instructed to modify a text file, use the text editor Notepad++. :pencil2: When you are finished with this guide, you will have forked `Spoon-Knife`, cloned the repo to the desktop, made/pushed a change, and made a pull request.  
		* **Be Social:** :pencil2: When you are finished with this guide, you will have followed another GitHub user (k8hertweck and/or a classmate) and watched [the GitHub repo for this class](https://github.com/k8hertweck/Bioinformatics). You may also want to star the repo for this class.
		* **Mastering Markdown:** You will use the information in this lesson to format your assessment (see below).
	* Take a look at the [GitHub Glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/). This will help with today's assessment and next week's lab.

* Set up your personal homework repository in the GitHub web interface. 
	* Fork the [`ForkMe` repo](https://github.com/k8hertweck/ForkMe)
	* Change the settings of this repo to private, and add your instructor (k8hertweck) as a collaborator. You may need to wait for your GitHub Student Developer Pack to be accepted before completing this section.
	* Prepare your repo for homework submission.
		* Go to the [GitHub help page](https://help.github.com) and find the article that describes how to rename a repository.
		* :pencil2: Use the information in that article to rename your new branch of `ForkMe` in the format `LastnameBioinf` (e.g., `HertweckBioinf`).
		* :pencil2: Modify the `README.md` file to inform readers of the intention for this repository. Please do not remove or modify the rubric table.
		* :pencil2: Edit and commit changes to `homeworkTemplate.md` to reflect your name and GitHub repo URL
		* :pencil2: Copy the text formatting from `homeworkTemplate.md` and create a new file with the name `LastnameWkX.md`, where Lastname is your last name and X is 1 (for week 1). Use this file to answer the questions in the assessment section below. If your repo is not yet private, save your answers in a separate text document to upload later.
